# Python Coding Assessment

# PHASE 1 Week 1 CODE CHALLENGE
## Overview

This repository contains solutions for a Python coding assessment that covers various fundamental Python concepts. The assessment includes tasks related to functions, decorators, sequences, sets, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.

## Setup and Running Instructions

 # Clone the Repository

git clone [git@github.com:Kiptoo16/phase-3-code-challenge-1.git]
cd your-repository
Ensure Python is Installed

Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can check this by running:

bash
Copy code
python --version
Run the Python Script

To run the script, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
This will execute the script and display the output of the Car class example.

# Functions and Class
add_numbers(num1, num2): Returns the sum of two numbers.
is_even(number): Returns True if the number is even, otherwise False.
reverse_string(text): Returns the reversed string.
count_vowels(text): Returns the count of vowels in the string.
calculate_factorial(n): Returns the factorial of a non-negative integer.
apply_decorator(func): Decorates a function to print "Decorator Applied" before execution.
sort_by_age(list_of_tuples): Sorts a list of tuples by age.
merge_dicts(dict1, dict2): Merges two dictionaries, summing values for common keys.
Car Class: Defines a car with attributes make, model, and year, and a method display_info().
Notes
Ensure that all functions and the class are implemented as described in the coding assessment.
The example usage of the Car class can be modified or expanded as needed.
For further customization or additional functionality, modify the script accordingly.
